savevars.pm
-----------

This module is for lazy people. All you do in your script is

	use savevars qw($bla %blubber @foo);

and you get these variables persistent in a configuration file.

Installation as usual:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make all test install

NOTE: The test program writes and deletes a configuration file names
.savevarstestrc in your home directory.
